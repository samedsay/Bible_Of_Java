 * (Perfect number)
 * A positive integer is called a perfect number if it is equal to the sum of all of its positive divisors, excluding itself.
 * For example, 6 is the first perfect number because 6 = 3 + 2 + 1.
 * The next is 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1.
 * There are four perfect numbers less than 10,000.
 * Write a program to find all these four numbers.
